# FAIRbyDesign

Frontend-only web application that guides ontology development by applying the **FAIR** principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) throughout the process, not only at the end. The tool organizes the workflow into **phases/activities**, provides **context and recommendations**, and integrates **automatic validations** when external services are available.

## What is FAIRbyDesign?
FAIRbyDesign is a web portal that accompanies users during the **ontology engineering process** through phase-based guided navigation, helping them keep track of “where they are” and “what comes next”. The goal is to reduce repetitive tasks through automatic support (forms and artifact generation) and to enable FAIR checks whenever possible via integrations with external services.

---

## Key Features
- Navigation through **phases/activities** from a central diagram.
- Per-activity content structured as:
  - **Summary**, actionable **steps**, **checks** (manual/automatic), **resources**, and links to FAIR principles.
- Integration with automatic validations via:
  - **FOOPS!** to run FAIR checks.
  - **Chowlk** to convert **diagrams → Turtle (TTL)**.
- **TTL metadata generator** through a guided form (base URI, prefix, version, license, etc.).
- **TTL merge**: combines metadata TTL with the TTL generated by Chowlk (when applicable).
- Lightweight, consistent, responsive UI (no custom backend).

---

## Architecture
The application is **100% client-side** (HTML/CSS/JS). It is deployed as a **static site** (e.g., GitHub Pages) and consumes external APIs via `fetch` from the browser.

**High-level components:**
- UI & navigation (phase diagram, menu, arrows)
- State manager (phase/activity) + dynamic content loading
- Content model (summary, steps, principles, resources…)
- Manual checks + progress indicator + links to external tools
- Forms: TTL metadata generator
- Integrations: FOOPS!/Chowlk clients + TTL merge

---

## How to Use
1. Open the portal.
2. Select a **phase** from the main diagram.
3. Follow the **steps** and complete the suggested **checks**.
4. When an automatic validation is available, run it (FOOPS!/Chowlk) and review the output.
5. Use the **metadata generator** to create the TTL snippet and, if needed, merge it with the TTL produced by Chowlk.
